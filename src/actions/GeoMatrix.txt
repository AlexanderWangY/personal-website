Spotify Recommendation Script

Authored by: Alexander Wang

Description:
A python script for calculating the distance matrix between all the class buildings on UF's campus. This came to approximately 10,000 different paths which was optimized to 5,000.
The algorithim involved building a 2D Matrix by blocking 30 x 30 matrices together in order to build the entire database of distances.
This is used inside the SwampScheduler website built by Robert Conde for class distance calculations for scheduling conflicts!
